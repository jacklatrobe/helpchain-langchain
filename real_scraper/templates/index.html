    <h1>Welcome to HelpChain</h1>
    <p>
        HelpChain is a novel software solution that utilizes large language models and advanced natural language processing techniques to enable semantic interactions with the software. </br>
        The solution leverages OpenAI, LangChain and more to combine some powerful components into a VERY powerful AI.</br>
        The key feature of HelpChain is its ability to chain multiple queries together to produce more complex results. </br>
        This means you can ask more complex, multi-stage questions like "What is the current weather in the hometown of steven hawking raised to the power of 8?"</br>
        Give it a shot below.

		<input type="text" id="queryField" name="query">
		<button type="submit">Submit</button>
